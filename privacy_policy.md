# Privacy Policy

Gobinath built `gcalendar` as a Free and Open Source tool to view Google Calendar events on terminal. This command-line tool is provided by Gobinath at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my desklet.

`gcalendar` requires you to authorize it to access your Google calendar events. `gcalendar` requires only read permission and does not modify any of your events. OAuth tokens will be stored in your computer itself and will not be shared with anyone else. `gcalendar` uses the token to retrieve your calendar events and show them on your desktop.

**None of your data is collected, stored, processed or shared with myself (the developer) or any third-parties.** You are more than welcome to check the source code or reach me out if you have any questions.

The app does rely on [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/) services that may collect information used to identify you. I highly recommend you to read [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information.

## Links to Other Services

This utility **does not** contain any links to any third-party services. Only service accessed by `gcalendar` is Google Calendar. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of Google Calendar sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update the Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
